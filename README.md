# Architecture

Canary utilises a microservice architecture, in which core processes are developed and deployed independently, in order to maintain a level of separation between core services, and improve scalability. The purpose of which is to ensure that development can remain isolated, with new features developed without the worry of impacting existing services.

# Additional Documentation

`README` files can be found under each microservice describing it's purpose and any other important information.
